	abstract = {During the past half-century notable changes have occurred in the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). To understand how the system functions as a whole, to evaluate the potential responses of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations, and to elucidate the relative magnitude of key biota and processes, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center instituted the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to establish an ecological network model (i.e., a more nuanced energy budget) of the entire Northeast U.S. food web. The EMAX work focused on the interdisciplinary development of a network model which reflected contemporary conditions (1996–2000) in four major regions of the ecosystem:, Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England and Middle Atlantic Bight. The model had 36 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of the biological hierarchy within each trophic level and incorporated a wide range of key rate processes. Because this ecosystem has been relatively well studied many of the biomass estimates were based on field measurements and biomass estimates from the scientific literature were required only for a relatively small number of nodes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes in the ecosystem. Our results show that small pelagic fishes are indeed keystone species in the ecosystem. We examined a suite of novel ecosystem metrics as we compared the four regions and provided a general, system-level description of the NEUS ecosystem. The general patterns of the network properties in the four regions were similar; however the network indices and metrics did reveal some noteworthy differences among regions reflecting their different oceanographic and faunal characteristics. The process of compiling and evaluating available data required by an ecosystem network model identified important gaps in our understanding which should be addressed during future ecosystem surveys. Moreover, exercises like EMAX will be a valuable starting point as we continue to progress towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM).},

	abstract = {The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.},

This, however, creates a problem with quality assurance; to address this we provide an overview of best practices for creating Ecopath models. We describe the diagnostics that can be used to check for thermodynamic and ecological principles, and highlight principles that should be used for balancing a model. We then highlight the pitfalls when comparing Ecopath models using Ecological Network Analysis indices. For dynamic simulations in Ecosim we show the state of the art in calibrating the model by fitting it to time series using a formal fitting procedure and statistical goodness of fit. Finally, we show how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to address uncertainty in input parameters, and we discuss the use of models in a management context, specifically using the concept of ‘key runs’ for ecosystem-based management. This novel list of best practices for EwE models will enable ecosystem managers to evaluate the goodness of fit of the given EwE model to the ecosystem management question.},

	abstract = {The MARMAP hydrographic data set (1977–1987) is used to determine the mean annual cycle of temperature, salinity, and density structure of surface waters throughout the Gulf of Maine. The temperatures follow the expected seasonal warming and cooling pattern. In the eastern Gulf the salinity cycle is dominated by influx of low salinity Scotian Shelf water which enters near Cape Sable in the winter, and in the western Gulf by the local spring runoff. Phasing of temperature and salinity cycles in different parts of the Gulf results in the western Gulf of Maine being more strongly stratified in the summer and more vertically uniform in the winter than is the eastern Gulf. The interannual variability, derived by subtracting the annual cycles from the original data, reveals relatively little temperature variability (1–2°C) during the period 1977–1987, compared to observed changes of 4–6°C in previous decades. Large interannual changes in salinity (0.5 psu), however, are evident in the data. The salinity variability is shown to be due primarily to changes in local fresh water sources—precipitation and runoff. Comparison of salinity changes in the Gulf of Maine with data from Georges Bank and the Middle Atlantic Bight shows that the salinity variability is coherent over the northeast continental shelf region from the western Gulf (Wilkinson Basin) to Cape Hatteras.},

	abstract = {The circulation in the Gulf of Maine has an important baroclinic component. It appears to be driven mostly by the density contrast between high-salinity slope water which enters from the Atlantic and fresher waters which are formed in the Gulf or which enter from the Scotian shelf. Hydrographie surveys in three successive spring seasons suggest that slope water accumulates in Georges Basin, driving a counterclockwise surface circulation which brings Scotian shelf water westward into the Gulf and contributes to the eastward jet along the inner edge of Georges Bank. The slope water also crosses a sill and enters Jordan Basin, where it provides a potential energy source which may enhance a counterclockwise gyre partly driven by nearshore buoyancy sources and perhaps the wind. The coastal limb of the gyre turns offshore east of Penobscot Bay. Part of the separated coastal current recirculates in Jordan Basin, and part of it continues into Wilkinson Basin, generating a clockwise eddy as it passes over Jeffreys Bank. There is little evidence for recirculating surface flow in Wilkinson Basin. Instead, the surface water appears to split into branches feeding the Jordan Basin gyre, the Georges Bank jet, and an export path to Nantucket Shoals. The Jordan and Georges branches seem to be divided by the denser slope water in Georges Basin, and this may be the central process controlling the vernal intensification of the circulation in the Gulf. A more complete dynamical understanding awaits models which include the baroclinic influence of boundary waters.},

The average temperature and salinity of the bottom water are presented from the different surveys for four regions of the Gulf—Wilkinson, Jordan, and Georges Basins and the Northeast Channel. The spatial variability across the Gulf was larger than the temporal variability in any region. The bottom water originates from Slope Water that enters the Gulf through the Northeast Channel. It is modified within the Gulf by vertical mixing with the near-surface waters of Scotian Shelf origin. A box model for the property changes during the summer-fall period indicates that the advection and mixing processes are of approximately equal importance in determining the bottom water properties. A winter convective input to the bottom layers is shown to occur only from the coastal areas around Wilkinson Basin in years when the surface salinity there was relatively high ({\textgreater}33.0‰). Advection and mixing rates calculated by the box model are in agreement with direct measurements of the inflow to the Gulf (Ramp et al., 1985) and mixing estimates from a budget for the intermediate layer waters in the Gulf (Hopkins and Garfield, 1979).},

	title = {Regime {Shift} in the {Gulf} of {Maine}},
	abstract = {Conventional wisdom, based on observations spanning two and a half decades (1975–2000), asserts that inflow to the Gulf of Maine (GoM) occurs primarily in two areas: inshore on the Scotian Shelf off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia and on the eastern side of the Northeast Channel (NEC). In particular, the monthly mean currents in the eastern NEC have shown persistent inflow at all depths and in all seasons, except for the occasional, but brief, reversals near the bottom ({\textasciitilde}200 m). Conversely, the flow on the western side of the NEC is normally directed out of the gulf in the surface layer and at mid-depth, consistent with the clockwise gyre over Georges Bank, but those currents do show relatively frequent reversals to inflow in the deeper layers (150–200 m), in sympathy with the flow on the eastern side. At some point between the year 2000, when the last Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)/U.S. GLOBEC mooring was removed from the eastern NEC, and 2004, when a new mooring was placed there as part of the U.S. ocean observing array, a transformation occurred. The recent data, collected from a representative location in the eastern NEC, show a strongly seasonal current signal marked by persistent periods of outflow in the deep layers ({\textgreater}100 m), particularly in winter. This observation was first reported by Pettigrew et al. (2008), where the outflow currents occasionally extend to the surface layers as well, most notably in the winters of 2004–2005 and 2006–2007. Additional data and analyses reported here suggest that this new mode of behavior in the NEC currents could have important consequences for the GoM ecosystem. Possible causes for this “regime shift” in the NEC circulation and implications for the GoM deepwater nutrient fields and ecosystem are discussed.},

	abstract = {Analysis of three years (October 1993–September 1996) of monthly mean current, temperature and salinity observations from moorings in the major Gulf of Maine (GOM) inflows off southwest Nova Scotia (C2) and in Northeast Channel (NECE) reveals some new features of the annual NECE cycles, including (1) a peak in near-surface ({\textless}75m) inflow in spring (vs. late summer at depth), suggesting that dynamic control of shallow and deep layers may be different, (2) a maximum near-surface cross-channel flow toward Georges Bank (GB) in late winter, suggesting a climatological tendency for Scotian Shelf “cross-overs” in that season, and (3) the absence of a significant salinity cycle over most of the water column. Deviations from the annual cycle indicate that the first part of the observation period was characterized by enhanced warm, saline, deep ({\textgreater}75m) NECE inflow, followed by later episodes of enhanced cold, fresh inflow at C2 and shallow NECE. Generally, the flow rates at C2 and deep NECE were out of phase, with increased inflow at C2 (deep NECE) associated with reduced inflow at deep NECE (C2) and cooler, fresher (warmer,saltier) conditions at both sites. Freshwater transport anomalies to the Gulf are maximum in the surface layers and largely negative(positive) over the first(last) half of the measurements. The timing of these freshwater inflow variations is consistent with observed fluctuations in hydrographic measurements in the GOM and GB, which reached peak salinities in late 1994, then declined through 1995–1996. Oxygen isotope analysis suggests that almost all of the fresh water present on the central cap of GB in 1996 and early 1997 is of northern (Scotian Shelf) origin as opposed to 1994 and 1995 when Maine River Waters contributed 38 and 26\%, respectively, to the freshwater (relative to 34.8) on the cap. A simple box model driven by observed changes in the boundary fluxes indicates that over the last half of the measurement period (April 1995–September 1996), the volumetric flow rate through the GOM increased by 105m3s−1 (roughly 17\% of the total transport, 5.83×105m3s−1), and that increased freshwater fluxes in the surface layers at C2 and NECE produced a net decrease of 0.73 in the salinity of the outflow waters. Average volumetric transports at C2(NECE) were roughly twice(half) those observed in the late 1970s, but the total is consistent with climtological estimates. The net change in the freshwater fluxes exceeds the total climatological mean estimate. Examination of possible local and remote sources confirms that the origin of the 1996–1997 freshwater anomaly is in the northern Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay and results from exceptionally cold winters in the early 1990s. Analysis of a similar event in the early 1980s suggests their occurrence is part of a quasi-decadal climate signal which follows the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).},

	abstract = {The percent of Labrador Slope Water (\%LSW) in the waters entering the Gulf of Maine at depth (150–200 m) through the Northeast Channel is estimated from temperature/salinity measurements for the period 1964–2008. Comparison of the annual average \%LSW with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) lagged two years shows that both series have very similar, but opposite, long term trends. High \%LSW in the 1960s decreased to low values in the 1990s as the NAO increased from low to high values over the same period. A regression of the residuals of the two series from their long term trends also is signiﬁcant at the 5\% level, indicating that the \%LSW at the Northeast Channel has a persistent relationship on a year-to-year basis with the NAO over the full range of variation in the NAO. The response of the \%LSW to the NAO, however, appeared substantially reduced after about 1990. Changes in the potential nutrient ﬂux into the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank system associated with changes in the \%LSW cannot account for changes in chlorophyll a concentrations estimated for three multi-year stanzas during the sampling period.},
