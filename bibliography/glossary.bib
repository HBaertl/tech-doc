abstract = "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena."

abstract = "Recognition of eutrophication as a process, rather than a state, that is driven by increasing anthropogenic nutrient loading was a key step in the evolution of our understanding of this ever-accelerating global issue. With coastal eutrophication having potentially detrimental consequences from both a socio-economic and ecological standpoint, management of this phenomenon requires a broad ecosystem approach that acknowledges the complex interactions that exist between drivers, stressors and responses (i.e., direct and indirect). Whilst intersystem comparisons are critical to gaining a mechanistic understanding of how eutrophication can manifest in varying environments, a site-specific approach is key to facilitating effective rehabilitation of eutrophic coastal ecosystems. The existence of legislative mandates that require the assessment of eutrophication through formulation of robust, multimetric frameworks is imperative in this regard. Even in regions where such legislation is lacking, eutrophication assessment methodologies should be implemented to serve as the basis for routine monitoring and setting of system-specific quantitative management goals. Finally, the successful reversal of eutrophic conditions hinges on (1) effective problem identification, (2) cognizance of system-specific attributes, (3) formulation of innovative policies to encourage compliance, (4) implementation of management actions to achieve set goals, and (5) a cooperative approach amongst stakeholders."

  abstract  = "Most U.S. fish stocks are fully or over-exploited, and harvesting in many fisheries far exceeds sustainable levels. The individual fishing quota (IFQ) is a relatively new instrument under which harvesting privileges are allocated to individual fishermen--innovative yet controversial for its feared effect on fishing communities and individual fishermen.\n\nBased on testimony from fishermen, regulators, environmentalists, and others, Sharing the Fish explores how IFQs might address the serious social, economic, and biologic issues raised by depleted fish stocks. In their approach to a national policy on IFQs, the panel makes direct recommendations to Congress, the Secretary of Commerce, the National Marine Fisheries Service, regional fishery management councils, state authorities, and others.\n\nThis book provides definitions and examples, reviews legislation and regulations, and includes lessons learned from fisheries on the U.S. East Coast and in Alaska, and in Iceland, New Zealand, and other nations. The committee discusses the public trust doctrine, management of common-pool resources, alternative and complementary approaches to the IFQ, and more.\n\nSharing the Fish provides straightforward answers that will be important to fishery policymakers and regulators, natural resource economists, fishery managers, environmental advocates, and concerned fishermen and their communities.\n",
