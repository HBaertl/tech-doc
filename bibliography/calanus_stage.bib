    abstract = "{Kane, J. 2007. Zooplankton abundance trends on Georges Bank, 1977–2004. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 909–919.Interannual trends in Georges Bank zooplankton abundance are described and related to variations in environmental variables for the period 1977–2004. Total zooplankton counts increased to above average levels in 1989 and stayed over or close to average through 2004. This analysis identified a group of taxa including Centropages typicus, Metridia lucens, and Temora longicornis that had similar interannual patterns of abundance. All these taxa increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. Some taxa declined sharply in 2002, others have continued elevated through 2004. Total zooplankton counts in the past two years were also boosted by a substantial increase in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Evidence is presented that these changes may be related to variations in Scotian Shelf inflow, which freshened water on the Northeast US continental shelf, perhaps increasing both primary production and the influx of zooplankton into the region. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of pelagic predators and the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, suggesting that bottom-up processes and advective supply are the key factors that regulate the Georges Bank foodweb.}",

    abstract = "{Kane, J. 2011. Multiyear variability of phytoplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1833–1841.Significant interannual changes in phytoplankton abundance were identified in the Continuous Plankton Recorder time-series collected in the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2008. Abundance levels of nearly all the common taxa began to increase in 1990 and remained elevated through 2001. During that period, total numbers were above average throughout the year, with an unusual bloom in late summer. Multivariate analysis of abundance identified three consecutive multiyear periods of varying abundance levels: low to average from 1961 to 1989, above average or very high from 1990 to 2001, and below average thereafter, through 2008. Phytoplankton abundance patterns were closely aligned to the rising trends displayed by several of the common zooplankton taxa. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental variable examined that showed some association with time-series abundance trends of plankton. The index was primarily positive in the 1990s, which would favour the propagation of warm, nutrient-rich slope water into the region. Perhaps the increased influx of this water, along with feedback enrichment from abundant zooplankton stocks and reduced top-down control by the relative scarcity of the dominant copepod Calanus finmarchicus, combined with a low salinity to make the 1990s a unique decade for plankton change in the Gulf of Maine.}",

abstract = {We investigated regime shifts in seasonal zooplankton communities of the Northeast continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES) and its subcomponent ecoregions over a multi-decadal period (1977–2013). Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular fluctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reflected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identified in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identified in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratification, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.}
