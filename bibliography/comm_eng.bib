abstract = {With the devastating impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and more recently the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, disaster questions about the vulnerability and resiliency of fishing communities in the Gulf of Mexico have been on the minds of local, regional, and national governmental agencies as well as numerous researchers and non-governmental organizations. The continued natural and now technological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico have placed a great deal of strain on communities dependent upon both commercial and recreational fishing. In 2008 a two-year long study to develop social indicators of vulnerability and resiliency for fishing-reliant communities in the Gulf of Mexico was undertaken. In addition, as part of the research design the accuracy of the social indicator descriptions of these places with ethnographic studies was triangulated. Comparisons of the combined ethnographic rankings with the quantitative indicators were positive and statistically significant. The research design thus confirmed that the developed indicators were, in fact, reliable measures for the concepts under consideration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Two unrelated data sources (quantitative secondary data and qualitative primary data) and mixed methodologies (statistical analysis and ethnography) are used to define the concept of, and develop indicators for, fishing dependence. Techniques for integrating differing data sources are developed. Comparisons of the qualitative rankings with the quantitative rankings were, overall, positive and statistically significant. The process used thus confirmed that the indicators were reliable measures for fishing dependence. In terms of external validity and triangulation, the process used was more rigorous than using ethnography "after-the-fact" to ground-truth the quantitative indicators. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of social indicators in this analysis of coastal communities enhances the eval-uation of the combined impacts of changes in fisheries management regulations and gentrification for fisheries social impact assessments. Increasing population pressure, declining fish stocks, and the attractiveness of natural amenities have all led to demo-graphic shifts and economic transformations for many coastal communities dependent on fishing. This impact of " gentrification " on the commercial fishing industry often precipitates a move toward non-marine based economies that can displace local resi-dents and their dependence on fishing as a way of life with resulting impacts to local economies and cultures. Drawing on the United States Census, National Marine Fish-eries Service, and other secondary data sources, social indicators were developed for 2,948 coastal communities in the Eastern United States and Gulf Coast and were used to evaluate gentrification pressure in select communities highly engaged in fishing. We anticipate this methodology, when groundtruthed and then combined with time-series assessments, will lead to improvements in the assessment of fishing community vulner-ability and resilience for the conduct of fisheries social impact assessments.},

@techreport{Jepson2013,
abstract = {Viable measures of social well-being and sustainability, including measures of vulnerability and resilience, are needed for coastal fishing communities. Although sustainable development indices have been created and implemented at national and regional levels, few are available at the local or community level, and even fewer address the social aspects of U.S. fisheries. We developed a suite of social indicators for use in fisheries social impact assessment (SIA). Data from more than 2,900 coastal communities in 19 states from Maine to Texas were used to create 14 social vulnerability and fishing dependence indices. Each index was developed using a factor analysis of secondary data obtained primarily from government sources, supplemented by a few private sources. The availability of these secondary data ensure replicability and feasibility under the time constraints usually available for completing social impact assessments for fishery management plans. Using cluster analysis, we selected a group of 20 communities to evaluate all 14 indices of social vulnerability. These indices can be used for cross-community and cross- regional comparisons, and will eventually be incorporated into social impact assessments of all U.S. marine fisheries.},
