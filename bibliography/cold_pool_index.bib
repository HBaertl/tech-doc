abstract = {Abstract The Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) Cold Pool is a distinctive cold (lower than 10°C) and relatively fresh (lower than 34 practical salinity unit) water mass. It is located over the middle and outer shelf of the MAB, below the seasonal thermocline, and is attached to the bottom. Following this definition, we put forward a method that includes three criteria to capture and quantify Cold Pool characteristics, based on a 50-year (1958–2007) high-resolution regional ocean model hindcast. The seasonal climatology of the Cold Pool and its properties are investigated during its onset-peak-decline cycle. Three stages of the Cold Pool event are defined according to its evolution and characteristics. The Cold Pool cores travel along the 60-m isobath starting south of the New England shelf to the Hudson Shelf Valley at a speed of 2–3cm/s. Furthermore, the northern extent of the Cold Pool retreats about 2.6 times faster than the southern extent during the summer progression. The heat balance of near-bottom waters over the MAB and Georges Bank is computed and it is found that the heat advection, rather than vertical diffusion, dominates the resulting spatial patterns of warming. Possible origins of the Cold Pool are investigated by performing a lead-lag correlation analysis. Results suggest that the Cold Pool originates not only from local remnants of winter water near the Nantucket Shoals, but has an upstream source traveling in the spring time from the southwestern flank of the Georges Bank along the 80-m isobath.},
