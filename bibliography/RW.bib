abstract = {Under the 1994 amendments of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) were required to generate stock assessment reports (SARs) for all marine mammal stocks in waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The first reports for the Atlantic (includes the Gulf of Mexico) were published in July 1995 (Blaylock et al. 1995). The MMPA requires NMFS and USFWS to review these reports annually for strategic stocks of marine mammals and at least every 3 years for stocks determined to be non-strategic. The second edition of the SARs (1996 assessments) was published in October 1997 and contained all the previous reports, but major revisions and updating were only completed for strategic stocks (Waring et al. 1997). In subsequent annual reports, including this current 2012 edition, updated reports are indicated by the corresponding year date-stamp at the top right corner of the report and are included in the main body of the document. Stock assessments not updated in the current year are included, in full, in an appendix. Also included in this report as appendices are: 1) a summary of serious injury/mortality estimates of marine mammals in observed U.S. fisheries (Appendix I), 2) a summary of NMFS records of large whale/human interactions examined for this assessment (Appendix II), 3) detailed fisheries information (Appendix III), 4) summary tables of abundance estimates generated over recent years and the surveys from which they are derived (Appendix IV), and 5) the the USFWS West Indian manatee assessments (Appendix VI). Table 1 contains a summary, by species, of the information included in the stock assessments, and also indicates those that have been revised since the 2011 publication. Most of the changes incorporate new information into sections on population size and/or mortality estimates. A total of 52 of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stock assessment reports were revised for 2012. The revised SARs include 15 strategic and 37 non-strategic stocks. Ten of the Atlantic reports required a second period of public and scientific review due to some changes in abundance estimates and are not available in this online edition. Full reports for North Atlantic stocks of sei whale, fin whale, minke whale, sperm whale, harbor porpoise, white-sided-dolphin, Risso's dolphin and the Cuvier's, Gervais' and Sowerby's beaked whales will be published in a subsequent volume of this document. This report was prepared by staff of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). NMFS staff presented the reports at the February 2012 meeting of the Atlantic Scientific Review Group (ASRG), and subsequent revisions were based on their contributions and constructive criticism. This is a working document and individual stock assessment reports will be updated as new information becomes available and as changes to marine mammal stocks and fisheries occur. The authors solicit any new information or comments which would improve future stock assessment reports.},

abstract = {North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis Müller 1776) present an interesting problem for abundance and trend estimation in marine wildlife conservation. They are long lived, individually identifiable, highly mobile, and one of the rarest of cetaceans. Individuals are annually resighted at different rates, primarily due to varying stay dura- tions among several principal habitats within a large geographic range. To date, char- acterizations of abundance have been produced that use simple accounting procedures with differing assumptions about mortality. To better characterize changing abun- dance of North Atlantic right whales between 1990 and 2015, we adapted a state– space formulation with Jolly-Seber assumptions about population entry (birth and immigration) to individual resighting histories and fit it using empirical Bayes method- ology. This hierarchical model included accommodation for the effect of the substan- tial individual capture heterogeneity. Estimates from this approach were only slightly higher than published accounting procedures, except for the most recent years (when recapture rates had declined substantially). North Atlantic right whales' abundance increased at about 2.8{\%} per annum from median point estimates of 270 individuals in 1990 to 483 in 2010, and then declined to 2015, when the final estimate was 458 in- dividuals (95{\%} credible intervals 444–471). The probability that the population's tra- jectory post-2010 was a decline was estimated at 99.99{\%}. Of special concern was the finding that reduced survival rates of adult females relative to adult males have pro- duced diverging abundance trends between sexes. Despite constraints in recent years, both biological (whales' distribution changing) and logistical (fewer resources available to collect individual photo-identifications), it is still possible to detect this relatively recent, small change in the population's trajectory. This is thanks to the massive data- set of individual North Atlantic right whale identifications accrued over the past three decades. Photo-identification data provide biological information that allows more in- formed inference on the status of this species.},
