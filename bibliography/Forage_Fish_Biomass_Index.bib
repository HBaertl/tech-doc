abstract = {Two new high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products have been developed using optimum interpolation (OI). The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses. The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006 onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the in situ data. The AMSR– AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because their error characteristics are independent.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {Diet-based annual biomass indices can potentially use predator stomach contents to provide information about prey biomass and may be particularly useful for species that are otherwise poorly sampled, including ecologically important forage fishes. However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

	abstract = {Summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) are an economically and ecologically important fish on the Northeast U.S. shelf. There is evidence that their spatial distribution has shifted over time. However, there are conflicting reports on the importance of various potential drivers of the shift. Here, we investigate whether the stock has shifted and the extent to which this can be attributed to changes in abundance, size-structure, environmental variables, and fishing. We do so using a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal model that incorporates data from two seasonal bottom trawl surveys that together span the nearshore and offshore Northeast US shelf over the past 41 years. We find that the summer flounder distribution has shifted north and east in both the spring and fall. The shift is observed in both recruits and spawners, with recruits shifting northward faster than spawners, suggesting that increased spawner abundance may not be driving the shift in recruits. We find that only a small portion of the variability in distribution can be attributed to changes in abundance, fishing, or environmental covariates. Instead, the shift is most strongly attributed to unidentified factors.},

	abstract = {Sympatric native Anolis species with similar structural habitats but contrasting climatic habitats are closer in head and body size on species—rich than on depauperate islands. In two localities, sympatric Anolis species with differential occurrences in sun or shade sought lower, more shaded perches during midday, resulting in partly nonsynchronous utilization of the vegetation by the two species. The second observation may be related to the first in the following way: nonsynchronous spatial overlap could dictate relatively great resource overlap for species coinhabiting patchy or edge areas, requiring great differences between the species in prey size in addition to those in climatic habitat. The extent of such overlap on small depauperate islands could be greater if these contained a greater proportion of patchy or edge habitats (with respect to insolation), or if climatic preferences were broader and more overlapping than on large, species—rich islands. In each locality, the relatively more shade—inhabiting species occurred more often on larger perches and on lower perches than did the other species. In both species of the Bermudan pair, adult males occupied higher and larger perches, and in grahami, shadier perches, than did female—sized individuals. The statistical significance of these and other differences was evaluated using several unweighted g2 procedures, Cochran's weighted g2 test and a partitioning technique for analyzing interactions among variables in complex contingency tables. The last method is described in detail in the papaer by Fienberg, immediately following this one.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (“derived quantities”) are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional “plug-in” estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new “epsilon” estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},
