abstract = {Condition assessment is commonly practiced by fisheries personnel as one tool for evaluating fish populations and communities. Several noninvasive condition measures are available for use, including Fulton's condition factor (K), relative condition factor (Kn), and relative weight (Wr). The use of Wr as a condition measure has increased within several peer- reviewed journals. In 1995 to 1996, survey responses from agency personnel in 48 states indicated that 22 states used Wr as a standard technique, 18 states identified Wr use as occasional, whereas only eight states indicated no Wr use. The regression-line-percentile technique is recommended for developing standard weight (Ws) equations. There are currently Ws equations available for 52 species and three purposeful hybrids. Length-related trends in condition need to be evaluated prior to calculating a population mean Wr. Relative weight target ranges should be adjusted to meet specific management objectives. Relative weight values are influenced by seasonal dynamics. The uses of Wr may go beyond just a measure of fish “plumpness.” Relative weight can serve as a surrogate for estimating fish body composition, as a measure of fish health, and to assess prey abundance, fish stockings, and management actions.},

@article{Cren1951a,
abstract = {1. The methods of analysing length-weight data from fish are reviewed. Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2{\%} of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},
