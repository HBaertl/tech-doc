Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2020 (Different Methods), 2021 (Different Methods), 2022) Indicator category:Published methods, Extensive analysis, not yet published Contributor(s): Hubert du Pontavice, Vincent Saba, Zhuomin Chen Data steward: Kimberly Bastille Kimberly.bastille@noaa.gov Point of contact: Hubert du Pontavice hubert.dupontavice@princeton.edu Public availability statement: Source data are NOT publicly available.Please email hubert.dupontavice@princeton.edu for further information and accessing the ROMS-NWA bottom temperature data. 15.1 Methods The methodology for the cold pool index changed between 2020, 2021, and 2022 SOEs. The most recent methods and at the top with older methods below those. The cold pool is an area of relatively cold bottom water that forms on the US northeast shelf in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. 15.1.1 Data Sources Three bottom temperature products are used to get bottom temperature from 1958 to 2021: Numerical simulation of the NWA Ocean was performed with the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS-NWA) (Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005)) PERIOD: 1958-1992 INITIAL RESOLUTION: ~7km REGRID: 1/10° Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis (Glorys reanalysis) (E. Fernandez and Lellouche (2018)) PERIOD: 1993-2019 INITIAL RESOLUTION: 1/12° REGRID: 1/10° https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_030/INFORMATION Global Ocean Physics Analysis and Forecast updated Daily (Lellouche et al.

(2016), Seidov, Baranova, Boyer, et al. (2016)). INITIAL RESOLUTION: 1/10° https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/northwest-atlantic-regional-climatology 15.1.2 Data Analysis 15.1.2.1 Cold Pool Index (Model_CPI) The Cold Pool Index (Model_CPI) was adapted from Miller et al. (2016). Residual temperature was calculated in each grid cell, i, in the Cold Pool domain as the difference between the average bottom temperature at the year y (Ty) and the average bottom temperature over the period 19582021 \\[({\\bar{T}}_{i,\\ 1972-2019})\\] between June and September. Model_CPI was calculated as the mean residual temperature over the Cold Pool domain such that: \\[{{CPI}_y}=\\ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(T}_{i,\\ y}\\ -\\ {\\bar{T}}_{i,\\ 1972-2019})\\ }}{n}\\] where n is the number of grid cells over the Cold Pool domain. 15.1.2.2 Persistence Index (Model_PI) The temporal component of the Cold Pool was calculated using the persistence index (Model_PI). Model_PI measures the duration of the Cold Pool and is estimated using the month when bottom temperature rises above 10C after the Cold Pool is formed each year. We first selected the area over the cold pool domain in which bottom temperature falls below 10C between June and October. We then calculated the residual month in each grid cell, i, in the Cold Pool domain as the difference between the month when bottom temperature rises above 10C in year y and the average of those months over the period 19722019. Then, Model_PI was calculated as the mean residual month over the Cold Pool domain: \\[{PI}_y=\\ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(Month}_{i,\\ y}\\ -\\ {\\bar{Month}}_{i,\\ 1972-2019})\\ }}{n}\\] 15.1.2.3 Spatial Extent Index (Model_SEI) The spatial component of the Cold Pool and the habitat provided by the cold pool was calculated using the Spatial Extent Index (Model_SEI). The Model_SEI is estimated by the number of cells where bottom temperature remains below 10C for at least 2 months between June and September. The Bottom temperature data are from ROMS-NWA between 1958 and 1992, from Glorys reanalysis between 1993 and 2019 and from Global Ocean Physics for 2020 and 2021. Bottom temperature from Glorys reanalysis and Global Ocean Physics Analysis were not being processed. Bottom temperature from ROMS-NWA (used for the period 1958-1992) were bias-corrected. Previous studies that focused on the ROMS-NWA-based Cold Pool highlighted strong and consistent warm bias in bottom temperature of about 1.5C during the stratified seasons over the period of 1958-2007 (Chen et al. (2018); Chen and Curchitser (2020)). In order to bias-correct bottom temperature from ROMS-NWA, we used the monthly climatologies of observed bottom temperature from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean regional climatology (NWARC) over decadal periods from 1955 to 1994. The NWARC provides high resolution (1/10° grids) of quality-controlled in situ ocean temperature based on a large volume of observed temperature data (Seidov, Baranova, Johnson, et al. (2016), Seidov, Baranova, Boyer, et al. (2016)) (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/northwest-atlantic-regional-climatology). The first step was to re-grid the ROMS-NWA to obtain bottom temperature over the same 1/10° grid as the NWARC. Then, a monthly bias was calculated in each grid cell and for each decade (19551964, 19651974, 19751984, 19851994) in the MAB and in the SNE shelf: \\[{BIAS}_{i,\\ d}=\\ T_{i,d}^{Climatology}\\ -\\ {\\bar{T}}_{i,\\ d}^{ROMS-NWA}\\] where \\[T_{i,d}^{Climatology}\\] is the NWARC bottom temperature in the grid cell i for the decade d and \\[{\\bar{T}}_{i,\\ d}^{ROMS-NWA}\\] is the average ROMS-NWA bottom temperature over the decade d in the grid cell i. 15.1.3 Data processing Code used to process the cold pool inidcator can be found in the ecodata package here. 15.1.4 Plotting The plot below was built using the code found here. 15.2 2021 Methods Point of Contact:: Zhoumin Chen zhuomin.chen@uconn.edu 15.2.1 Data Sources The three-dimensional temperature of the Northeast US shelf is downloaded from the CMEMS (https://marine.copernicus.eu/).
