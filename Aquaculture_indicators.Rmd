## Methods
Aquaculture data included in the SOE report were time series of number of oysters sold in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. 


### Data source(s) (All types)
Virginia oyster harvest data are collected from mail and internet-based surveys of active oyster aquaculture operations on both sides of the Chesapeake Bay, which are then synthesized in an annual report [@Hudson2017a]. In Maryland, shellfish aquaculturists are required to report their monthly harvests to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD-DNR). The MD-DNR then aggregates the harvest data for release in the Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council Annual Report [@ACC2017], from which data were collected. Similar to Virginia, New Jersey releases annual reports synthesizing electronic survey results from lease-holding shellfish growers. Data from New Jersey reflects cage reared oysters grown from hatchery seed [@Calvo2017]. 


### Data extraction 
Data were collected directly from state aquaculture reports. Oysters harvest data in MD was reported in bushels which were then converted to individual oysters by an estimate of 300 oysters bushel$^{-1}$.
