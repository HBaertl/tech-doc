# Process raw common tern productivity and diet data

# If save == TRUE, processed data are saved as a .Rds file to the data directory. 

# Function returns a processed data frame containing time series of productivity and diet
# composition for common tern at different islands in southern Gulf of Maine. The first three letters
# in the variable "Var" correspond to the island at which sampling occurred, with COTE referring to 
# Common Tern. If "Var" includes productivity, then "Value" is the average number of fledged chicks.
# Otherwise, if "Var" specifies diet, then  "Value"  is equal to the count of observed prey type. 
# For example, "EER COTE Diet Amphipod" refers to the number of preyed upon amphipods observed at Eastern
# Egg Rock in a given year.
