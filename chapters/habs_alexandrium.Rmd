## Methods
### Data Sources

*Alexandrium* cysts in sediments of the Gulf of Maine have been monitored through a cooperative effort of NOAA, WHOI, and other partners for over twenty years.  Sampling methods are described in @Anderson2005.  In the annual survey cruises, samples are obtained with a Craib corer, and *Alexandrium* cysts are counted from the top 1- cm of sediment layer. Results are extrapolated to estimate overall cyst abundance in the eastern, western, and entire Gulf of Maine.Results are reported as estimated total numbers of cells (10 to the 16th power) in Eastern Gulf of Maine (east of Penobscot Bay), Western Gulf of Maine (west of Penobscot Bay), Bay of Fundy (2003-2013 only), and entire Gulf of Maine.

Tabular data provided by Yizhen Li, NOAA/NOS NCCOS Stressor Detection and Impacts Division, HAB Forecasting Branch. 

### Data Analysis

The spatial distribution and abundance of cyst cells from the annual survey are used to drive an ecosystem forecast model for the Gulf of Maine (@Anderson2005, @Li2009, @Li2020, @McGillicuddy2011). The model also includes many other inputs of dynamic oceanographic data such as currents, temperature, and nutrients. Operational Harmful Algal Bloom forecast is served online at https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/research/stressor-impacts-mitigation/hab-forecasts/gulf-of-maine-alexandrium-catenella-predictive-models/.

### Data Processing

Code for processing *Alexandrium* cyst data can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_habs.R).

### Plotting

The script used to develop the figure in the SOE Indicator Catalog can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_NE.Rmd-habs-alex.R).

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_NE.Rmd-habs-alex.R"), echo = F, eval = T, fig.cap="Gulf of Maine Alexandrium Cyst abundance."}

```


```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_NE.Rmd-habs-alex-distibution.R"), echo = F, fig.align="center", eval = T,out.width = "80%", fig.cap="Gulf of Maine Alexandrium Cyst distribution."}
