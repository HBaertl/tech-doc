## Methods


### Data sources
Survey data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) trawl database. These data in their derived form are available through [Survdat](#survdat).


### Data extraction 
Data were extracted from [Survdat](#survdat).


### Data analysis
We defined size thresholds separating small and large fish for each species based on the 20th percentile of the length distribution across all years. This threshold was then used to calculate a small and large fish index (numbers below and above the threshold, respectively) each year. Although the length percentile corresponding to age-1 fish will vary with species, we use the 20th percentile as an approximation. Biomass was calculated using lengthâ€“weight relationships directly from the survey data. Following @wigley_length-weight_2003, the length-weight relationship was modeled as 
$$\ln W = \ln a + b \ln L$$
where $W$ is weight (kg), $L$ is length (cm), and $a$ and $b$ are parameters fit via linear regression. The ratio of small fish numbers of the following year to larger fish biomass in the current year was used as the index of recruitment success. The fall and spring recruitment success anomalies were averaged to provide an annual index of recruitment success.

### Data processing

Productivity data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_productivity_anomaly.R).
