## Methods

The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) have recently requested regional Ocean Acidification (OA) information in the State of the Ecosystem reports. The work included in the State of the Ecosystem 2021 report, [seasonal dynamics of pH in shelf waters in the Mid-Atlantic](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/ocean-acidification.html#ref-Wright2020), was synthesized from @Wright2020. The maps included in the State of the Ecosystem 2022 reports include a plot of bottom pH in summer over the entire U.S. Northeast Shelf (2007-present), and glider-based pH profiles during summer 2021 in both the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) and the Gulf of Maine. The plots in the 2023 State of the Ecosystem reports, maps of bottom summer aragonite saturation ($\\Omega_{Arag}$) and locations where summer bottom $\\Omega_{Arag}$ reached lab-derived sensitivity levels of designated target species, were developed using openly accessible, quality-controlled data from vessel-based discrete samples and glider-based measurements (see Data Sources).

### Data sources

Glider-based observations of pH pH (and other variables including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-*a*, and dissolved oxygen) began in the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight region in May 2018 (@Saba2019), and seasonal glider pH missions thereafter began in February 2019 (@Wright2020; although no deployments occurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID pandemic). Simultaneous measurements from the glider's pH, temperature, and salinity sensors enable the derivation of total alkalinity and calculation of other carbonate system parameters including $\\Omega_{Arag}$. The glider pH observation program expanded spatially, with additional deployments in the northern MAB (New York Bight) and the Gulf of Maine, starting in February 2021. A typical glider mission runs for about 4 weeks, covers 500 km, and collects data though the full water column. Full-resolution delayed-mode glider datasets containing raw pH voltages can be found on [RUCOOL's Glider ERDDAP Server](http://slocum-data.marine.rutgers.edu/erddap/index.html). Fully-processed and time-shifted pH glider datasets can be found [here](https://marine.rutgers.edu/~lgarzio/cinar_soe/glider_data/).


Vessel-based discrete carbinate chemistry data were mined from the Coastal Ocean Data Analysis Product in North America, version v2021 ([CODAP-NA](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/2777/2021/); @Jiang2021). This data product synthesizes two decades of quality-controlled inorganic carbon system parameters (including pH, total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon) along with other physical and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) collected from the North American continental shelves.

Additionally, two recent vessel-based datasets that were not included in CODAP-NA (@Jiang2021) were included in this synthesis. These datasets were collected during more recent NOAA NEFSC Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) surveys (June 2019, Cruise ID HB1902; August 2019, Cruise ID GU1902; August 2021, Cruise ID PC2104)) and include quality-controlled spectrophotometric-based pH measurements on discrete water samples. Data can be accessed through the [NCEI Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data Portal](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/ocean-carbon-acidification-data-system-portal/).

### Data extraction

Glider data were processed and quality-controlled by software technician Lori Garzio at Rutgers University.

[CODAP-NA data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/metadata/0219960.html) were accessed and downloaded on October 14, 2021. 

EcoMon datasets were accessed and downloaded on October 13, 2022.

### Data processing

For processing and quality-control procedures of glider-based data, see @Wright2020. Glider data used in this synthesis were limited to summer only (June - August).

Data from CODAP-NA were filtered temporally to include only those collected during summer months (June-August) and were spatially limited to the U.S. Northeast Shelf. The resulting datasets included those from major vessel-based campaigns (East Coast Ocean Acidification, ECOA I and II cruises 2015 and 2018; The Gulf of Maine and East Coast Carbon cruises, GOMECC 2007 and 2012; EcoMon 2012-2013, 2015-2019).

For vessel-based datasets, when $\\Omega_{Arag}$ was unavailable it was calculated using PyCO2SYS (@Humphreys2020) with inputs of pressure, temperature, salinity, total alkalinity, and pH.


For MAB glider datasets, total alkalinity was calculated from salinity using a linear relationship determined from *in situ* water sampling data taken during glider deployment and recovery in addition to ship-based water samples (@Wright2020). For the Gulf of Maine glider dataset, total alkalinity was calculated from temperature and salinity using Table 3 Equation IV in @McGarry2021. Calculations for $\\Omega_{Arag}$ were then conducted using PyCO2SYS (@Humphreys2020) with inputs of pressure, temperature, salinity, totalalkalinity, and pH.


### Plotting


1. A plot of bottom $\\Omega_{Arag}$ in summer over the entire U.S. Northeast Shelf (all available data from 2007-present and includes both glider-based measurements and vessel-based discrete samples)
  + This map is included in both MAFMC and NEFMC reports.
  + Bottom values were defined as the median of the measurements (or calculated
$\\Omega_{Arag}$ values) within the deepest 1m of a glider profile or, for vessel-based measurements, the deepest measurement of a vertical CTD/Rosette cast where water samples were collected, for profiles deeper than 10m. In order to validate whether the deepest depth was at or near the bottom, the sampling depth was compared to water column depth (when provided) or water depths extracted from a [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/) bathymetry grid based on the sample collection coordinates. Any glider profiles/vessel-based casts with the deepest measurement shallower than the bottom 20% of total water column depth were removed. This allowed for a sliding scale instead of providing a strict cut off (e.g., 1 m above the bottom).

2. Maps depicting locations where summer bottom $\\Omega_{Arag}$ reached lab-derived sensitivity levels of designated target species
  + Sensitivity levels of $\\Omega_{Arag}$ were defined for each species as values of $\\Omega_{Arag}$ where negative responses by an organism were observed during an experimental laboratory study. Typically, these laboratory experiments measure organism responses under ocean acidification conditions (lower pH, lower $\\Omega_{Arag}$) against a control under ambient conditions (higher pH, higher $\\Omega_{Arag}$). Most laboratory experiments have used a range of $\\Omega_{Arag}$ between 0.5 to 2.0, which does not encompass the full range of $\\Omega_{Arag}$ observed *in situ*. The metrics measured (e.g., survival, growth, calcification) can be different between experiments, but negative responses could include decreased survival, reduced growth, reduced calcification rate, reduced hatching success, and malformation. Because laboratory perturbation experiments testing the responses of organisms to ocean acidification conditions are a relatively new approach and logistically quite challenging, there are currently few published studies for individual species. Recent studies have also started incorporating additional stressors, which makes defining an OA-focused sensitivity level difficult. Therefore, with additional future studies, the $\\Omega_{Arag}$ sensitivity levels defined here for these species are subject to change.
  + For the MAFMC report, designated target species included Atlantic sea scallop (*Placopecten magellanicus*) and Longfin squid (*Doryteuthis pealeii*). The sensitivity value used for Atlantic sea scallop was $\\Omega_{Arag}$ ≤ 1.1 at 9 C, based on reduced adult calcification rate observed at this level in @Cameron2022. The sensitivity value used for longfin squid was $\\Omega_{Arag}$ ≤ 0.96, based on embryo and paralarvae malformation, increased time to hatching and decreased hatching
success, and changes to mantle length and statolith morphology observed at this level in @Zafroff2019 and @Zafroff2020. Habitat depth ranges used for plotting the observed $\\Omega_{Arag}$ values ≤ sensitivity $\\Omega_{Arag}$ values for Atlantic sea scallop and longfin squid were limited to 25-200 meters (NEFSC 2014) and 0-400 meters (@Jacobson2005), respectively.
  + For the NEFMC report, designated target species included Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) and American lobster (*Homarus americanus*). The sensitivity value used for Atlantic cod was $\\Omega_{Arag}$ ≤ 1.31 at 10 C, based on decreased larval survival observed at this level in @Stiasny2016. The sensitivity value used for American lobster was $\\Omega_{Arag}$ ≤ 1.09, based on decreased stage V and VI juvenile survival observed at this level in @Noisette2021. Habitat depth ranges used for plotting the observed $\\Omega_{Arag}$ values ≤ sensitivity$\\Omega_{Arag}$ values for Atlantic cod and American lobster were limited to 10-200 meters (@Gregory2004; @DeCelles2017) and 10-700 meters (@Mercaldo-Allen1994), respectively.
