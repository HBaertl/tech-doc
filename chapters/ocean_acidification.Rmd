## Methods

The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) have recently requested regional Ocean Acidification (OA) information in the State of the Ecosystem reports. The work included in the State of the Ecosystem 2021 report, [seasonal dynamics of pH in shelf waters in the Mid-Atlantic](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/ocean-acidification.html#ref-Wright2020), was synthesized from @Wright2020. The maps included in the State of the Ecosystem 2022 reports include a plot of bottom pH in summer over the entire U.S. Northeast Shelf (2007-present), and glider-based pH profiles during summer 2021 in both the Mid-Atlantic and the Gulf of Maine. These plots were developed using openly accessible, quality-controlled data from vessel-based discrete samples and glider-based measurements of pH (see Data Sources).


### Data sources

Glider-based pH observations began in the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight region in May 2018 (@Saba2019), and seasonal glider pH missions thereafter began in February 2019 (@Wright2020; although no deployments occurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID pandemic). The glider pH observation program expanded spatially, with additional deployments in the northern MAB (New York Bight) and the Gulf of Maine, starting in February 2021. A typical glider mission runs for about 4 weeks, covers 500 km, and collects data though the full water column. Full-resolution delayed-mode glider datasets containing raw pH voltages can be found on [RUCOOL's Glider ERDDAP Server](http://slocum-data.marine.rutgers.edu/erddap/index.html). Fully-processed and time-shifted pH glider datasets can be found [here](https://marine.rutgers.edu/~lgarzio/cinar_soe/glider_data/).


Vessel-based discrete pH data were mined from the Coastal Ocean Data Analysis Product in North America, version v2021 ([CODAP-NA](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/2777/2021/); @Jiang2021). This data product synthesizes two decades of quality-controlled inorganic carbon system parameters (including pH, total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon) along with other physical and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) collected from the North American continental shelves.

Additionally, two recent vessel-based datasets that were not included in CODAP-NA (@Jiang2021) were included in this synthesis. These datasets were collected during more recent NOAA NEFSC Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) surveys (June 2019, Cruise ID HB1902; August 2019, Cruise ID GU1902) and include quality-controlled spectrophotometric-based pH measurements on discrete water samples. Data can be requested from Chris Melrose (chris.melrose@noaa.gov).

### Data extraction

Glider data were processed and quality-controlled by software technician Lori Garzio at Rutgers University.

[CODAP-NA data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/metadata/0219960.html) were accessed and downloaded on October 14, 2021. 


### Data processing

For processing and quality-control procedures of glider-based data, see @Wright2020. Glider data used in this synthesis were limited to summer only (June - August).

Data from CODAP-NA were filtered temporally to include only those collected during summer months (June-August) and were spatially limited to the U.S. Northeast Shelf. The resulting datasets included those from major vessel-based campaigns (East Coast Ocean Acidification, ECOA I and II cruises 2015 and 2018; The Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Carbon cruises, GOMECC 2007 and 2012; EcoMon 2012-2013, 2015-2019).

Three maps were constructed: 1) A plot of bottom pH in summer over the entire U.S. Northeast Shelf (all available data from 2007-present and includes both glider-based measurements and vessel-based discrete pH samples); 2) pH profiles from two gliders deployed in the Mid-Atlantic during summer 2021; and 3) Glider-based pH profiles from a deployment during summer in Gulf of Maine.

For the plot of U.S. Northeast Shelf, bottom pH was defined as the median of the measurements within the deepest 1m of a glider profile or, for vessel-based measurements, the deepest measurement of a vertical CTD/Rosette cast where water samples were collected, for profiles deeper than 10m. In order to validate whether the deepest depth was at or near the bottom, the sampling depth was compared to water column depth (when provided) or water depths extracted from a [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/) bathymetry grid based on the sample collection coordinates. Any glider profiles/vessel-based casts with the deepest measurement shallower than the bottom 20% of total water column depth were removed. This allowed for a sliding scale instead of providing a strict cut off (e.g., 1 m above the bottom).
