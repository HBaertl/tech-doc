## Methods

### Data sources
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) accessed via the  Copernicus Climate Change Service https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form. The 3-hour data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and are freely available to the public.

### Data Extraction
The following variables were extracted from the input data: 
+ 10m_u_component_of_wind
+ '10m_v_component_of_wind
+ Mean_sea_level_pressure
+ Mean_wave_period
+ significant_height_of_combined_wind_waves_and_swell

Extractions were limited to the region bounded by 80°W, 50°N, 60°W, and 20°N.  

Extraction code fetch_data.py is available at:  https://github.com/nrcc-cornell/regional-swh  
Data were subset into five regions: southern Mid-Atlantic bight, northern Mid-Atlantic bight, Georges Bank, western Gulf of Maine, eastern Gulf of Maine.

### Data Processing 

Code for processing wind process_data.py and wave data can be found at: 
https://github.com/nrcc-cornell/regional-swh 

The wind index was defined using four thresholds set at the beginning of the processing code.  Gale_thres = 34 kts, temporal_thres = 3 hours, intervene = 96 hours, and st = 0.25.  These translate to the index defining storminess events as windspeeds ≥34kts that persist for at least 3hrs, are separated from previous events by at least 96 hrs and occur at more than 25% of the 30km grid points within a region.
For wave height data, the same thresholds are used with the exception of gale_thres being replaced with wave_t=5.  This sets the index to events with >5m wave heights.  


The data were analyzed at their base 1-hour temporal and 30 km spatial resolutions.  At each gridpoint falling within a region (e.g. southern Mid-Atlantic bight) the raw data were screened to identify winds exceeding the gale threshold. Then each point was further analyzed to determine if at least 3 consecutive hours exceeded the threshold.  If more than 25% of the grid points within the region met these criteria, an event was indicated and the annual event tally for the region was increased by one, provided it was separated from a previous event by >96 hours. 

Code used to process storminess data for inclusion in `ecodata` can be found on github - [NOAA-EDAB/ecodata](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_storminess.R).

### Plotting
`ecodata` code for data manipulation and plotting can be found here: https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_MAB.Rmd-storminess.R

```{r, echo = F, fig.align="center", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path(image.dir, "storminess_N_events.png")))

```

Additional plots were generated externally, with the data processing code outputting the relevant time series of storm counts.  Individual sample plots are available at https://github.com/nrcc-cornell/regional-swh/tree/main/graphs

```{r, echo = F, fig.align="center", fig.cap=""}

knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path(image.dir, "storminess_N_events_region.png")))

```
