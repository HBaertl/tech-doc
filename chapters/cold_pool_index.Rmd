## Methods
The methodology for the cold pool index changed between 2020 and 2021 SOEs. The most recent methods and at the top with older methods below those.

### Data Sources
The three-dimensional temperature of the Northeast US shelf is downloaded from the CMEMS (https://marine.copernicus.eu/). Source data is available [at this link](https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_030).

### Data Analysis
Depth-averaged spatial temperature is calculated based on the daily Cold Pool dataset, which is quantified following Chen et al., 2018.

### Data processing

Code used to process the cold pool inidcator can be found in the `ecodata` package [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_cold_pool.R). 

### Plotting
The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-cold_pool_map.R). 

```{r, fig.cap=" "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "cold_pool_map.png"))
```

<!-- ```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_MAB.Rmd-cold_pool_map.R"), fig.cap = "Cold Pool Index", fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=F} -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Data sources
NEFSC Hydrographic Database
This data represents the annual mean bottom temperature residual for Sept-Oct in the Mid-Atlantic Bight cold pool region from 1977-2018.

### Data extraction 


### Data analysis
Methods published @miller2016, [original MATLAB source code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/R/stored_scripts/cold_pool_analysis.txt) used in that paper was provided by Jon Hare and used in this analysis.
