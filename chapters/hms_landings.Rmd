## Methods


### Data sources
Data from eDealer database (website) and Bluefin Tuna Dealer reports on SAFIS.


### Data extraction 
Data was processed for Fisheries of the United States and then aggregated by region to avoid confidentiality issues.

### Data analysis
High migratory landings include 19 species of tunas, sharks and swordfish. 

Data was analyzed using Excel pivot tables.


### Data processing
HMS landings data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_hms_landings_rev.R).

### Plotting

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions.Rmd-comm_landings.R). 

```{r, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/master/R/stored_scripts/hms_landings_plotting.R"), eval = T, echo = F, fig.cap = "Highly migratory species landings from 2016-2018 grouped by sharks, tunas and swordfish."}

```
