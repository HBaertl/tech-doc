## Methods

Daily Level 3 mapped (4km resolution, sinusoidally projected) satellite chlorophyll data were obtained from the European Space Agencyâ€™s Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative project. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data included the 4 km nighttime NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder (@Casey2010; @Saha2018) and the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR, version 4.1) Level 4 (@Chin2017; @Project2015) data.  Prior to June 2002, AVHRR Pathfinder data were used as the SST source and MUR SST in subsequent years.

### Data sources

The global chlorophyll data were subset to the U.S. East Coast (SW longitude=-82.5, SW latitude=22.5, NE longitude=-51.5, NE latitude=48.5) and stored in a nearly equal-area, integerized sinusoidal grid. The global SST data were also subset to the same East Coast region and remapped to the same sinusoidal grid. 


### Data analysis

Phytoplankton size classes were calculated according to @Turner2020 (in prep).  The regionally tuned abundance-based model is based on the three-component model of @Brewin2010 that varies as a function of SST (@Brewin2017, @Moore2020).  The model uses a look-up table with parameters indexed by SST, developed using a local data set of HPLC diagnostic pigment-derived phytoplankton size fractions matched with coincident satellite SST.

Statistics, including the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were calculated at weekly, monthly, and annual time steps and for several climatological periods. Annual statistics used the monthly means as inputs to avoid a summer time bias when more data is available due to reduced cloud cover. The daily, weekly, monthly and annual climatological statistics include the entire time series for each specified period. For example, the climatological January uses the monthly mean from each January in the time series and the climatological annual uses the annual mean from each year. 

The ecological production unit (EPU) shapefile that excludes the estuaries was used to spatially extract all data location within an ecoregion from the statistic and anomaly files. The median values, which are equivalent to the geometric mean, were used for the CHL and PP data. 

### Data processing

Code used to process the phytoplankton size class inidcator can be found in the `ecodata` package [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_phyto_size.R). 

### Plotting 

Code for plotting Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine bottom temperature time series can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_MAB.Rmd-weekly-phyto-size.R). 

```{r, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL_MAB.Rmd-weekly-phyto-size.R"), eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Mid-Atlantic phytoplankton size class."}
