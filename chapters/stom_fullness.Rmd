**Public availability statement**: NEFSC survey data used in these analyses are available upon request (see [Food Habits Database (FHDBS)](https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport) for access procedures). Derived stomach fullness data are available [here](https://comet.nefsc.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/) (STILL NEEDS SOE REFERENCE!).


## Methods
An index of stomach fullness was calculated from NEFSC autumn bottom trawl food habits data.

### Data sources


### Data extraction 


### Data analysis


### Data processing


### Plotting

Fish stomach fullness index was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using this [R code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_stom_fullness.R). 

### Plotting

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna.Rmd-ma-stomachs.R). 


```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna.Rmd-ma-stomachs.R"), eval = T, fig.cap= "Stomach fullness anomaly."}

```
