## Methods
We used total recreational harvest as an indicator of seafood production and total recreational trips and total recreational anglers as proxies for recreational value generated from the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions respectively. We estimated both recreational catch diversity in species manages by the Fisheries Management Councils; Mid-Atlantic (MAFMC), New England (NEFMC) and Atlantic States (ASFMC) and fleet effort diversity using the effective Shannon index. 

### Data sources
All recreational shark fishing indicator data, in were downloaded from the Marine Recreational Information Program [MRIP Recreational Fisheries Statistics Queries](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index) portal. 

Data sets were queried by region on the MRIP site, and for the purposes of the State of the Ecosystem reports, the "NORTH ATLANTIC" and "MID-ATLANTIC" regions were mapped to the New England and Mid-Atlantic report versions respectively. All query pages are accessible through the [MRIP Recreational Fisheries Statistics](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index) site. 

### Data analysis

MRIP data were grouped used the shark species groupings found in [this table](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/hms-mrip/species_list.csv).

### Data processing

Recreational shark fishing indicators were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using this [code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_rec_hms.R).


### Plotting

Code used to create the plot below can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_NE.Rmd-rec_hms.R).

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_NE.Rmd-rec_hms.R"), fig.cap = "Total recreational shark landings in the New England.", eval=T, echo=F}
