**Description**: CPUE from pelagic observer program (POP) observed hauls, presented as number of fish per haul, is provided for the northeast (shelf-wide) by year/species from 1992-2019.

**Indicator category**: Database pull with analysis

**Found in**: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2021+), State of the Ecosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2021+)

**Public availability statement**: Source data are NOT publicly available. Pelagic observer data is considered confidential data, and must be screened to ensure that data meet requirements for "rule of three" at the set and vessel level before they can be distributed. 


## Methods

### Data sources
Data for this indicator were compiled by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Larry Beerkircher. These data come from the NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center databases holding the Atlantic highly migratory species information from the pelagic observer program. 

The Southeast Pelagic Observer Program monitors the pelagic longline fleet all along the Northeast U.S. Shelf. This covers approximately 1000 hauls per year and targets 8% coverage of the fishing effort. 


### Data analysis

Catch per unit effort was calculated as number of individuals per haul and summarized by year and species. 

The species groupings are available in the table below.
