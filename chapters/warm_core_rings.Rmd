## Methods
The methods used to determine number of warm core ring births and the analysis of regime shift are described in @gangopadhyay2019. 

### Data sources
Satellite data was compiled in to 2-3 day charts that were using in the regime shift analysis. 

### Data extraction 
Data was requested from Avijit Gangopandhyay directly through email. 

### Data analysis
NA

### Data processing
Warm core ring data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using this [R code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_warm_core_rings.R). 

### Plotting

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-warm-core-rings.R). 


```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-warm-core-rings.R"), eval = T, fig.cap= " Interannual Variability of the WCR formation between 1980 and 2019. The regime shift (denoted by the split in the red solid line) is significant at the turn of the century.  Figure reproduced with permission from Gangopadhyay, et al.
