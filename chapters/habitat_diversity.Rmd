# Habitat Diversity 

**Description**: Species richness was derived from the Northeast Regional Habitat Assessment models for 55 common species sampled by the 2000-2019 spring and fall NEFSC bottom trawl surveys. The joint species distribution model controls for differences in capture efficiency across survey vessels.
 

**Indicator category**: Extensive analysis

**Found in**: State of the Ecosystem - New England (2023), 
State of the Ecosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2023)

### Data analysis

#### Species Richness 

Estimated species richness is the number of unique species expected to be observed in NEFSC bottom trawl surveys conducted in a given ecological production unit (EPU) and year, based on a fitted joint-species distribution/habitat suitability model (considering only the 55 commonly-occurring species listed above).

 
#### Model Fitting


A spatiotemporal joint species distribution model was fitted to n=13231 observations of presence/absence in the Spring and Fall NEFSC bottom trawl surveys for the years 2000-2019, using the [Community Level Basis Function Model (CBFM) framework](https://github.com/fhui28/CBFM) with a binomial error distribution and logistic link function.  The probability of presence was modeled as a function of environmental predictor variables (using smooth terms), a vessel effect (factor) to account for changes in sampling gear, as well as spatiotemporal (Lat, Lon, Month) and temporal (Year) random effects, which were estimated hierarchically through a set of species-common basis functions. The model thus controls for differences in capture efficiency across survey vessels, permitting predictions on a common scale (here calibrated to the RFV Albatross IV).

#### Environmental Covariates

Covariate values (i.e., environmental parameters) corresponding to the approximate location (and time, when applicable) of each observation (i.e., tow) were extracted from the following sources:
Monthly mean surface and bottom temperature, surface and bottom salinity, and sea surface height anomaly were obtained from the GLORYS12V1 reanalysis (@Lellouche2012), as were annual minimum and maximum surface and bottom temperatures.

Monthly mean underwater optical parameters, including the intensity (photosynthetically active radiation - PAR) and spectral composition (hue angle) of downwelling light at mid-water column, were estimated from remote sensing data, following the methods of @Lee2005 and @Lee2022, respectively.

Hydrodynamic stress near the seabed (95th quantile) was obtained from the USGS Sea Floor Stress and Sediment Mobility database (Dalyander et al. 2012).


Annually-integrated chlorophyll was obtained from the Oceancolour-CCI (version 5) release (https://www.oceancolour.org/).

Bathymetric position index (BPI), benthic structural complexity, and sediment type data were estimated following the methods described at: https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/reportsdata/marine/namera/namera/Pages/default.aspx/

#### Estimating Richness

Simulating from the fitted model, we generated 100 random draws of “joint” predictions of the species assemblage observed in the survey, taking into account species residual covariances (see @Wilkinson2021 for additional details). We used these to produce estimates of the mean species richness (and corresponding 95% prediction intervals) across all observations within each ecological production unit (EPU) for each modeled year (2000-2019).
