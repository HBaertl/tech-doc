## Methods
We used kernel density plots to depict shifts in species' distributions over time. These figures characterize the probability of a species occurring in a given area based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Bottom Trawl Survey data. Kernel density estimates (KDEs) of distributions are shown for the period of 1970-1979 (shaded blue) and most recent three years of survey data (shaded red) (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:kde-fig)). Results are typically visualized for spring and fall bottom trawl surveys seperately. 

Three probability levels (25%, 50%, 75%) are shown for each time period, where the 25% region depicts the core area of the distribution and the 75% region shows the area occupied more broadly by the species. A wide array of KDEs for many ecologically and economically important species on the Northeast US Continental Shelf are available [here](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/ecosys/current-conditions/kernel-density.html).

### Data sources
Current and historical species distributions are based on the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey data (aka ["Survdat"](#survdat)) and depth strata. Strata are available as shapefiles that can be downloaded  [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/gis) (listed as 
"strata.shp"). 

### Data analysis

Code used for species density analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/blob/master/R/stored_scripts/species_density_analysis.R). 
```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/master/R/stored_scripts/species_density_analysis.R"), eval=T, echo=F}

```

### Plotting

```{r kde-fig, fig.cap="Current and historical sea scallop kernel density estimates derived from spring survey data. Current estimates derived from 2016-2018 data.", echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "species_density_estimate.png"))
