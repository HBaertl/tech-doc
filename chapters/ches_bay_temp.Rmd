## Methods
Seasonal average sea surface temperature (SST) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument, 2008-present, is composited from individual daytime and nighttime overpasses over the U.S. east coast into daily mean grids (~1.25 km), then the daily grids are averaged into gridded monthly temperature composites. Then the monthly temperatures are averaged into gridded seasonal temperature composites.

### Data sources
The AVHRR instrument flies on the NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and European MetOp satellites. Currently, there are 5 instances of the AVHRR instrument, each on one satellite, covering overpass times at roughly 1:30am, 9:30am, 1:30pm, 9:30pm (local time) per day. With multiple overpass times, a daily composite provides adequate geographic coverage, monthly composites provide near complete geographic coverage, and seasonal composites provide complete geographic coverage.

SST is generated by NOAA/NESDIS from High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) overpasses (1.1 km at nadir) using Seaspace's TeraScan software and NOAA's multi-channel regression algorithm (@Li2001a & @Li2001b) in near real-time for coastal waters of the United States.

SST is measured using AVHRR's infrared channels.

### Data analysis
Anomaly maps of SST are generated by creating long-term 'climatological' SST of the years 2008-2019 for each season. The seasonal SST for 2020 is then subtracted from the long-term seasonal average for each season.


NOAA's CoastWatch Utilities Library contains the following library functions to generate the long-term average, seasonal average, anomaly (by subtraction), and map image:
  * cwcomposite, cwmath, cwrender
These are contained in the following Bash shell scripts:
  * nrt_daily_avhrr_sst.sh
  * nrt_monthly.sh
  * series_seasonal.sh
  * climatology_seasonal.sh
  * anomaly_gen.sh
The CoastWatch Utilities Library is free software which may be obtained from NOAA's CoastWatch Program:
