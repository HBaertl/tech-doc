## Methods

### Data sources

GLOBAL OCEAN GRIDDED L4 SEA SURFACE HEIGHTS AND DERIVED VARIABLES REPROCESSED (1993-ONGOING).  http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_047

### Data analysis

The GSI is calculated based on the method presented by @perez-hernandez2014. It is a simple 16-point GS index constructed by selecting grid points following the max. Standard deviation of SLA, every 1.33° longitude between 52° and 72°W and averaging them. The value of 1.33° is based on the resolution of satellite dataset from AVISO previously.  We followed the same method, except using the dataset from [CMEMS](http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_047), which has a 0.25°x0.25° resolution. Therefore we select points every 1° between 52° and 72° and average them, and there are 21 points in total.

### Data Processing

The Gulf Stream index data set was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package with the code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_gsi.R).

### Plotting

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-GSI.R). 

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-GSI.R"), eval = T, echo=F, fig.cap="Gulf Stream Index" }
