## Methods


### Data sources

Data came from the Northeast Habitat Climate Vulnerability Assessment (HCVA; not yet published), the Northeast Fish and Shellfish Climate Vulnerability Assessment (FCVA; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146756)  and the Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat Partnership’s (ACFHP) Species-Habitat Matrix (https://www.atlanticfishhabitat.org/species-habitat-matrix/#:~:text=The%20Species%2DHabitat%20Matrix%20is,selected%20fish%20and%20invertebrate%20species)

### Data analysis

We assessed the vulnerability of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to climate change. The northern and southern boundaries of the study area are the U.S./Canadian border and Cape Hatteras, NC, respectively, and the study includes habitats out to the U.S. EEZ and up-river to capture the full range of diadromous species. 

This habitat climate vulnerability assessment (HCVA) builds on the Northeast Fish and Shellfish Climate Vulnerability Assessment (FCVA) completed in 2016 (Hare et al. 2016), and uses a similar framework. While the species assessment primarily examined climate vulnerability based on life history, the HCVA assesses the vulnerability of the habitats themselves to climate change, and complements the species assessment by improving our understanding of how vulnerable habitats will impact fish and invertebrate populations.

To better understand which species depend on vulnerable habitats, the Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat Partnership (ACFHP) habitat-species matrix (Kritzer et al. 2016) was used in conjunction with the results of the HCVA and the FCVA. The ACFHP matrix identified the importance of nearshore benthic habitats to each life stage of select fish species, which helps elucidate species that may be highly dependent on highly vulnerable habitats that were identified in the HCVA.

#### HCVA Methods:
The Northeast HCVA is a trait-based vulnerability assessment which was adapted from the framework developed for NOAA’s Fish Stock Climate Vulnerability Assessment (Morrison et al. 2015). The HCVA considers the overall vulnerability of habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components: exposure and sensitivity. The exposure component considers the magnitude and overlap of projected changes in climate with the distribution of each habitat. Climate exposure is assessed using end-of-century climate projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. The sensitivity component includes nine habitat attributes, or traits, that are believed to be indicative of the response of a habitat to potential changes in climate. The assessment methodology relies on an expert opinion-based approach to determine the sensitivity of each habitat to potential climate change related impacts. The sensitivity is combined with the climate exposure information to determine the overall vulnerability rank. 

#### Methods for linking habitat vulnerability results with species:
The Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat Partnership (ACFHP) habitat-species matrix (Kritzer et al. 2016) was consulted and linked with the results of the HCVA and the FCVA in order to understand which federally managed species that are highly dependent on highly vulnerable habitats. 

The ACFHP habitat-species matrix evaluated the importance of 26 benthic habitat types to select fish and invertebrate species. Each habitat type was assigned a rank of “very high,” “high,” “moderate,” or “low,” reflecting a species’ use of the habitat at a specific life stage. Detailed descriptions of the rationale behind the rankings can be found in Kritzer et al. (2016). 

Using habitat descriptions from Kritzer et al. (2016), the 26 habitats analyzed by ACFHP were matched with HCVA habitats that best fit under the same description. Several habitat types that were included in the HCVA but not assessed by ACFHP were omitted from this analysis (e.g., manmade hard bottom habitats, aquaculture, invasive salt marsh and wetlands, water column habitats). A species-habitat matrix was then created using the species that were assessed in both the FCVA and by ACFHP, and the habitat importance ranking (very high, high, moderate, low) from the ACFHP matrix for each habitat type. Because the ACFHP habitat types were broader, several HCVA habitats often fit under a single ACFHP habitat; therefore, to determine which HCVA habitat a species/life stage actually uses under the broader ACFHP habitat, species profiles from the Northeast Regional Habitat Assessment (NRHA) and EFH Source Documents were consulted.

Species highlighted here are those that are highly dependent on highly vulnerable habitats. A ranking matrix was created using the habitat vulnerability rankings compared to the habitat importance rankings to determine the criteria, and for the purposes of this submission, “high dependence on a highly vulnerable habitat” encompasses moderate use of very highly vulnerable habitats, high use of highly or very highly vulnerable habitats, or very high use of moderately, highly, or very highly vulnerable habitats.


### Data Processing

The Habitat Vulnerability information table was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package with the code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_habitat_vulnerability.R).

### Plotting

## 2019 Methods

Summarized from @joyce2019, ocean temperature data from NOAA NODC were sorted by latitude, longitude, and time using a resolution of 1`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), '\\textdegree', '&deg;')` of longitude, latitude, and 3 months of time, respectively, with a Gaussian squared weighting from the selected desired point in a window twice the size of the desired resolution. Editing was used to reject duplicate samples and 3$\sigma$ outliers from each selected sample point prior to performing the weighting and averaging; the latter was only carried out when there were at least three data points in the selected interval for each sample point. Typically, 50 or more data values were available. The resulting temperature field was therefore smoothed. Data along the Gulf Stream north wall at nine data points were used to assemble a spatial/temporal sampling of the temperature at 200m data along the north wall from 75`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), '\\textdegree ', '&deg;')`W to 55`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), '\\textdegree ', '&deg;')`W. The leading mode of temperature variability of the Gulf Stream is equivalent to a north‐south shift of 50–100 km, which is zonally of one sign and amounts to 50\% of the seasonal‐interannual variance between 75`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), '\\textdegree ', '&deg;')`W and 55`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), '\\textdegree ', '&deg;')`W. The temporal behavior of this mode (PC1) shows the temporal shift of the Gulf Stream path with a dominant approximately 8‐ to 10‐year periodicity over much of the period.
