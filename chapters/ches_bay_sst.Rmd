## Methods


### Data sources
Data for Chesapeake Bay seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were derived from the NOAA Multi-satellite AVHRR SST data set, available from NOAA CoastWatch [East Coast Regional Node](https://eastcoast.coastwatch.noaa.gov). The data set is a composite of overpasses from all operational satellites currently flying the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument. SST is derived using the Operational Non-linear Multichannel SST Algorithm (@Li2001a, @Li2001b). Both daytime and nighttime overpasses are composited into daily and then seasonal SST products. The data extend from 2008 to present, and provide a 1.25 km x 1.25 km grid of SST measurements.

### Data analysis
Anomaly maps of SST are generated by creating long-term ‘climatological’ seasonal average SST for the years from 2008 to the year immediately prior to the current year `(max(Year) - 1)`. The reference period serves as a benchmark for comparing current observations. The current-year seasonal SST is then subtracted from the long-term seasonal average. Seasons for Chesapeake Bay are Dec-Feb (winter), Mar-May (spring), Jun-Aug (summer), and Sep-Nov (fall).
