## Methods
The data presented here represent integrated persistent annual hotspots derived from at-sea observations of seabirds, cetaceans and sea turtles collected on systematic ship and aerial surveys.


### Data sources
Individual hotspot richness maps represent summed annual persistent hotspots of 82 species (sea turtles, n=5; cetaceans, n = 29; seabirds, n= 48).   Hotspot richness values also include 20 common and abundant seabird taxa challenging to identify to the species level on aerial surveys but whose abundance and spatial patterns significantly contribute to seabird richness and diversity on the Atlantic EEZ (e.g., loon sp.; phalarope sp.). Federal, state, and academic institutions embraced systematic aerial and ship-based surveys to examine seabird, cetacean, and sea turtle distribution and abundance on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf in the 1970s.  Federal agencies (BOEM, NOAA, USFWS, and the US Navy) continue seasonal surveys under the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protect species (AMAPPS) and others. AMAPPS covers broad areas of the Atlantic EEZ to assess mangaged stocks of protected species and the potential impacts of offshore energy production on marine wildlife populations. Observer-based programs use two main survey methods to estimate densities at sea from ships and aircraft 1) the strip-width method (@White2020) and 2 ) distance sampling (@Palka2017). The annual persistent hotspot maps presented here of seabirds, cetaceans, and sea turtles were derived from observations and survey effort archived in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog; NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center's (NEFSC) AMAPPS database; NEFSC's Right Whale Aerial Survey database; and MassCEC's database of surveys off southern New England.

### Data analysis
All detailed data processing steps are not currently included in this document, but general steps are outlined.  Species-specific persistent hotspots were computed with observations and survey effort collected on ship and aerial surveys from 1978-2019.  Species-specific hotspots were derived with daily timesteps on 20 x 20 km grids representing the Atlantic EEZ. Hotspot probabilities (i.e., persistence) were derived by summing the number of daily hotspots divided by the number of time steps (@Gende2006), which produced a continuum of probabilistic hotspots ranging from 0 to 1 across a final species-specific grid.  Annual hotspot richness maps were derived  by summing the species-specifc grid cells with high persistence.

### Data processing
Persistent hotspots were computed with the sf and raster R packages.
