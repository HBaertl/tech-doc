## Methods
### Data Sources
BOEM Lease Area shapefiles; 
NY Call Area shapefiles; 
Table E-4 of South Fork Wind Farm Draft EIS; 
Table A-4 of South Fork Wind Farm Draft EIS.

### Data Analysis
Variable Calculations
Assign Coordinate System 
Project tool: Project Coordinate System to shapefile Project_Areas_12_3_2019, NY_Call_Areas, BOEM_NY_Draft_WEAs_11_1_2018:  GEOGCS['GCS_North_American_1983',DATUM['D_North_American_1983',SPHEROID['GRS_1980',6378137.0,298.257222101]],PRIMEM['Greenwich',0.0],UNIT['Degree',0.0174532925199433]]: 

Spatial Analysis for Project_Acres:
Project Areas and Call Area acres were calculated using BOEM Project Area Shapefiles (Project_Areas_12_3_2019), BOEM NY Call Area Shapefiles (NY_Call_Areas), and NY Call Area Primary and Secondary Recommendation shapefiles (BOEM_NY_Draft_WEAs_11_1_2018) in ArcMap. 
Project_Areas_12_3_2019, NY_Call_Areas, and BOEM_NY_Draft_WEAs_11_1_2018 Acres were calculated using Add Field and Field Calculator tool. Python Expression = !shape.area@acres!

Project_Name:  Table E-4 of South Fork DEIS Project names were matched to shapefiles by name and lease number. 
FDNS: Number of foundations proposed or expected for each Project area taken directly from Table E-4 of South Fork DEIS.
SeaDist_FndScr_Acres: Values taken directly from Table A-4 in South Fork DEIS (Table A-4: Offshore Wind Leasing Activities in the U.S. East Coast: Projects and Assumptions [part 2], pg. E-3-4). Total values for MA/RI lease areas Bay State Wind, Liberty Wind, OCS-A 0522 Remainder, OCS-A 0500 Remainder, OCS-A 0521 Remainder, OCS-A 0520 were aggregated in the table (528 total acres). For these lease areas the total number of foundations from table E-4 (Future Offshore Wind Project Construction Schedule, pg. E-14) were aggregated (SUM function). The percent of each project’s foundation to the total was calculated. The same percent value to the total foundations was applied to SeaDist_FndScr_Acres  (% of Individual Projects FDNS to total group’s foundations/100)*528). These values should be treated as estimates until more information is released specific to individual project areas.
Offsh_Cbl_Acres: Values taken directly from Table A-4 in South Fork DEIS (Table A-4: Offshore Wind Leasing Activities in the U.S. East Coast: Projects and Assumptions [part 2], pg. E-3-4). Total values for MA/RI lease areas Bay State Wind, Liberty Wind, OCS-A 0522 Remainder, OCS-A 0500 Remainder, OCS-A 0521 Remainder, OCS-A 0520 were aggregated in the table (567 total acres).  Values were evenly distributed across the 6 Project areas.  As such, these values should be treated as estimates until more information is released specific to individual project areas and their landing sites. 
Dominion Energy was presented as 3 phases in Table E-4 for Project_Name (Dominion Energy Phase1, Dominion Energy Phase 2, Dominion Energy Phase 3). Only one Project shapefile area exists for this lease  area OCS-A 0483. Therefore, the total shapefile acreage was evenly divided between 3 phases similar to how the foundations were treated in table E-4 (Future Offshore Wind Project Construction Schedule, pg. E-14). 
OffExpCab_Miles: Offshore Export Cable Length OCS-A 0482, OCS-A 0519 OCS-A 0490 had 360 offshore export cable miles reported in Table E-4. This number was divided by 3 and 120 were assigned to these three project areas. 

### Data Processing 

Data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using the R code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_wind_dev_speed.R).

### Plotting

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-wind-dev-speed0.30.R).
