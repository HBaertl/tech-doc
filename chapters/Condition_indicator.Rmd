## Methods
Relative condition (Kn) was introduced by @Cren1951a as a way to remove the influence of length on condition, and @Blackwell2000 noted that Kn may be useful in detecting prolonged physical stress on a fish populations. Relative condition is calculated as
$$Kn = W/W',$$ where $W$ is the weight of an individual fish and $W'$ is the predicted length-specific mean weight for the fish population in a given region. "Here, relative condition was calculated for finfish stocks commonly caught on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s (NEFSC) autumn and spring bottom trawl surveys, from 1992-present. 

Where data allowed, predicted length-weight parameters were calculated for $W’$ by species, sex and season over the time period 1992-2012. When sample sizes of individual fish weights and lengths were too low, parameters were calculated for aggregated spring and fall survey data over the same time period. Fall survey relative condition was calculated by sex for those species that exhibited differences in growth between sexes and aggregated across sex for those that did not.

The `Condition` package used for calculations and plotting of fish condition factor can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition).

### Data sources
Individual fish lengths (to the nearest 0.5 cm) and weights (grams) were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys from 1992-present aboard RVs Albatross IV, Delaware II and the Henry B. Bigelow  (see [Survdat](#survdat)). A small number of outlier values were removed when calculating the length-weight parameters.

### Data extraction
Data were extracted from NEFSC's survey database (SVDBS) using the R script found [here](https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition/blob/master/R/pull_from_svdbs.R) 

### Data analysis
The following growth curve was fit through individual fish lengths and weights from the NEFSC bottom trawl survey data from 1992-2012 to produce reference length-weight parameters:


$$\textrm{Weight} = e^{Fall_{coef}} * \textrm{Length}^{Fall_{exp}},$$

where length is in cm and weight is in kg. Fall survey data were used where sample sizes allowed for growth curve estimation, otherwise data from spring and fall seasons were combined. 

Individual fish lengths from NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey from 1992-2017 were then used to calculate predicted weights using the reference length-weight parameters. Relative condition ($Kn$) was calculated annually by species and sex (for sexually dimorphic species) by dividing individual fish weights by the predicted weight. 

The code found [here](https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition/blob/master/R/RelConditionEPU.R) was used in the analysis of fish condition.
