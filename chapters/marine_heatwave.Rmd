## Methods
Marine heatwave analysis for Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine, and the Middle Atlantic Bight according to the definition in @hobday2016.  

### Data sources
NOAA high-res OISST (daily, 25-km, 1982-2019)   https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/db_search/DBListFiles.pl?did=132&tid=79458&vid=2423

### Data extraction 
Each yearly file (global) was downloaded, concatenated into a single netcdf file using nco (Unix), and then cropped to the USNES region using Ferret.  Each EPU's time-series of SST was averaged using .shp file boundaries for the MAB, GB, and GOM (also done in Ferret) and saved to the three .csv files.

### Data analysis
The marine heatwave metrics Maximum Intensity [deg. C] and Cumulative Intensity [deg. C x days] are calculated using NOAA OISST daily sea surface temperature data (25-km resolution) from January 1982 to December 2019.  The heatwaves are calculated based on the algorithms in Hobday et al. 2016 and by using a climatology of 1982-2010.  These metrics were run R using https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/

### Data processing 
Marine Heatwave data were formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package using this [R code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_heatwave.R).

### Plotting

Code used for the plots below can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-heatwave_mab.R).


```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-heatwave_mab.R"), eval = T, echo=F, fig.cap="Cumulative and maximum marine heatwave in the Mid-Atlantic", fig.align="center"}

```
