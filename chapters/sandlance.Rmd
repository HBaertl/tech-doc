## Methods
### Data Sources

This data set is taken directly from Table 1, Silva et al. 2020.  See full citation in "References" section below.

### Data Analysis

Data processing and analysis methods are described in @Silva2020.  The catch counts of sand lance and observational counts of humpback whales and great shearwater were used to derive spatial metrics (center of gravity, and inertia) for each species.  Equations for these spatial metrics are provided in Table 2 of @Silva2020. The spatial metrics (center of gravity,  inertia) were used to calculate the global index of collocation (GIC) to quantify spatial overlap between pairs of species for each cruise.  GICs for species pairs are reported in Table 3 of @Silva2020, but data were not sufficient to calculate GICs for each pair of species in each cruise.



### Data Processing

Code for processing salinity data can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_sandlance.R).

### Plotting

Code use to build the plot below can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_NE.Rmd-sandlance-colocation.R).

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_NE.Rmd-sandlance.R"), echo = F, fig.align="center", eval = T, fig.cap="These four line graphs (Mean Sandlance, Number of Samples, Number of Samples with Fish, and Proportion of Non-Zero Samples) are metrics derived directly from the raw survey data (SBNMS 2021).  Collectively they illustrate a cyclical pattern of abundance, with higher abundance 2014-2016, and lower abundance 2017-2019.  Since the data set has many zero-capture samples, the Proportion of Non-Zero Samples may be a useful metric as a proxy for abundance."}

```

```{r , code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_NE.Rmd-sandlance-colocation.R"), echo = F, fig.align="center", eval = T, fig.cap="The multi-line plot labeled Sandlance illustrates the collocation of sandlance with humpback whale and great shearwater.  Data are taken directly from Table 1 of Silva et al. 2020.  Although it may not be visually evident from the annual-summed values, there is strong spatial collocation among sand lance, humpbacks and shearwaters across seasons and years."}
