## Methods
### Data Sources

This data set is taken directly from Table 1, Silva et al. 2020.  See full citation in "References" section below.

### Data Analysis

Data processing and analysis methods are described in Silva et al. 2020.  The catch counts of sand lance and observational counts of humpback whales and great shearwater were used to derive spatial metrics (center of gravity, and inertia) for each species.  Equations for these spatial metrics are provided in Table 2 of Silva et al. 2020. The spatial metrics (center of gravity,  inertia) were used to calculate the global index of collocation (GIC) to quantify spatial overlap between pairs of species for each cruise.  GICs for species pairs are reported in Table 3 of Silva et al. 2020, but data were not sufficient to calculate GICs for each pair of species in each cruise.



### Data Processing

Code for processing salinity data can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_sandlance.R).

### Plotting

Code use to build the plot below can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_NE.Rmd-sandlance-colocation.R).
