## Methods

A collaborative project between UMASS Dartmouth Biology Department (Dr. Ken Oliveira, M.S student Kelcie Bean) and NEFSC Population Biology Branch (Mark Wuenschel) is underway to evaluate energy content of forage species. The study focuses on the following species; Atlantic herring, alewife, silver hake, butterfish, northern sandlance, Atlantic mackerel, longfin squid, and northern shortfin squid. Samples have been analyzed for proximate composition and energy density from 2017 and 2018 NEFSC spring and fall bottom trawl surveys (Bean 2019, table below). Predictive relationships between the percent dry weight of samples and energy density were developed, and samples collected from 2019 surveys are currently being analyzed for percentage dry weight to enable estimation of energy content. The energy density of forage species differed from prior studies in the 1980s and 1990s (@steimle1985, @lawson1998).
