abstract = {A phosphatase inhibition assay for detection of okadaic acid (OA) toxins in shellfish, OkaTest, was single laboratory validated according to international recognized guidelines (AOAC, EURACHEM). Special emphasis was placed on the ruggedness of the method and stability of the components. All reagents were stable for more than 6 months and the method was highly robust under normal laboratory conditions. The limit of detection and quantification were 44 and 56 µg/kg, respectively; both below the European legal limit of 160 µg/kg. The repeatability was evaluated with 2 naturally contaminated samples. The relative standard deviation (RSD) calculated was 1.4{\%} at a level of 276 µg/kg and 3.9{\%} at 124 µg/kg. Intermediate precision was estimated by testing 10 different samples (mussel and scallop) on three different days and ranged between 2.4 and 9.5{\%}. The IC(50) values of the phosphatase used in this assay were determined for OA (1.2 nM), DTX-1 (1.6 nM) and DTX-2 (1.2 nM). The accuracy of the method was estimated by recovery testing for OA (mussel, 78-101{\%}; king scallop, 98-114{\%}), DTX-1 (king scallop, 79-102{\%}) and DTX-2 (king scallop, 93{\%}). Finally, the method was qualitatively compared to the mouse bioassay and LC-MS/MS.},

@article{Quilliam1995,
abstract = {Domoic acid is the toxin responsible for incidents of amnesic shellfish poisoning. A rapid extraction and cleanup for the liquid chromatographic determination of domoic acid in unsalted seafood is reported. The method uses a single-step extraction with 50{\%} aqueous methanol and a selective cleanup and preconcentration with strong-anion exchange, solid-phase extraction. Determination is performed by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection. The detection limit was 20-30 ng/g. Recoveries of 93{\%} were achieved from 0.2 to 20 µg/g in mussel tissues. The method gave a precision of less than 3{\%} for concentrations greater than 2 µg/g and less than 6{\%} at 0.2 µg/g. A linear dynamic range of 104 can be achieved. The method was successfully applied to a variety of seafood products, including mussels, razor clams, crabs, and anchovies},

@article{Boundy2015,
abstract = {Routine regulatory monitoring of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) commonly employs oxidative derivitisation and complex liquid chromatography fluorescence detection methods (LC-FL). The pre-column oxidation LC-FL method is currently implemented in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. When using this method positive samples are fractionated and two different oxidations are required to confirm the identity and quantity of each PST analogue present. There is a need for alternative methods that are simpler, provide faster turnaround times and have improved detection limits. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) HPLC-MS/MS analysis of PST has been used for research purposes, but high detection limits and substantial sample matrix issues have prevented it from becoming a viable alternative for routine monitoring purposes. We have developed a HILIC UPLC-MS/MS method for paralytic shellfish toxins with an optimised desalting clean-up procedure on inexpensive carbon solid phase extraction cartridges for reduction of matrix interferences. This represents a major technical breakthrough and allows sensitive, selective and rapid analysis of paralytic shellfish toxins from a variety of sample types, including many commercially produced bivalve molluscan shellfish species. Additionally, this analytical approach avoids the need for complex calculations to determine sample toxicity, as unlike other methods each PST analogue is able to be quantified as a single resolved peak. This article presents the method development and optimisation information. A thorough single laboratory validation study has subsequently been performed and this data will be presented elsewhere.},

@techreport{Stutts2017,
abstract = {Shellfish contaminated with natural toxins can cause consumer illnesses. The Food and Drug Administration has established guidance levels for five groups of natural toxins in shellfish responsible for the following illnesses: amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Shellfish hazards for domestic products are managed under the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP), but at present approved and approved limited use methods are only available for ASP, NSP, and PSP. Shellfish harvesting closures have been required due to DSP toxins in excess of the established regulatory guidance level of 16 µg OA eq./100 g shellfish on the Texas Gulf Coast since 2008, in the Puget Sound region since 2011, and in the New England region since 2015. This report describes the validation of an LC‐MS/MS method for DSP toxins for use in the NSSP for the control of this hazard in clams. Once found to be fit for purpose for clams, the method will be fully validated for the additional matrices of mussel and oyster. Due to the immediate need for approved methods for this toxin group it was felt that submitting this proposal now, with the available full SLV data for clam, was important. Preliminary data is available for mussel and oyster such that the method can be used for these matrices in an approved limited use capacity.},
