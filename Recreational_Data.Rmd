## Methods
We use total recreational harvest as an indicator of seafood production and total recreational trips and total recreational anglers as proxies for recreational value generated from the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions respectively.

### Data source(s)
The number of harvested fish was downloaded from the MRIP National Query December 12, 2017.  Harvested fish is TOTAL HARVEST (A+B1). Note that 2017 is considered preliminary at the time of the pull. The series can be found at https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index, and map the "NORTH ATLANTIC" Region to "NE" and "MID-ATLANTIC" Region to "MA" for purposes of the SOE. The number of angler trips and number of anglers was pulled from two sources on December 12, 2017.  Angler trips is "TOTAL" trips, was pulled from the MRIP effort data time series, and includes data from 1981 - 2017. Note that 2017 is considered preliminary at the time of the pull. The number of anglers is total number of anglers from the MRFSS participation time series, and includes data from 1981 - 2016. Both series can be found at https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index, and map the "NORTH ATLANTIC" Region to "NE" and "MID-ATLANTIC" Region to "MA" for purposes of the SOE.

### Data extraction 
Data must be downloaded into a csv, which is then imported to R for the purpose of the SOE.
