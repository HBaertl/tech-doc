<!--The purpose of this form is to provide the methods used to collect, process, and analyze derived data prior to data submission for all EDAB reports. This information will be compiled into the State of the Ecosystem Tech Memo, AND be used to meet metadata requirements put forth by the Public Access to Research Results (PARR) directive. 

For the tech memo, we will be documenting the methods behind each indicator to the level of a peer-reviewed document.-->

## Methods
Conceptual models were constructed to facilitate multidisciplinary analysis and discussion of the linked social-ecological system for integrated ecosystem assessment. The overall process was to first identify the components of the model (focal groups, human activities, environmental drivers, and objectives), and then to document criteria for including groups and linkages and what the specific links were between the components.

The prototype conceptual model used to design Northeast US conceptual models for each ecosystem production unit (EPU) was designed by the California Current IEA program. The California Current IEA developed an overview conceptual model for the Northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (NCC)  (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/Assets/iea/california/conceptual-models/Integrated-SocioEcological-System-Overview6.png), with models for each focal ecosystem component that detailed the ecological, environmental, and human system linkages (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-overview.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-environmental.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-ecological.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-human.html#). Another set of conceptual models outlined habitat linkages (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/mediating-components/habitat.html). 

An inital conceptual model for Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine was outlined at the 2015 ICES WGNARS meeting. It specified four categories: Large scale drivers, focal ecosystem components, human activities, and human well being. Strategic management objectives were included in the conceptual model, which had not been done in the NCC. Focal ecosystem components were defined as aggregate species groups that had associated US management objectives (outlined within WGNARS for IEAs, see @depiper_operationalizing_2017): groundfish, forage fish, fished invertebrates, living habitat, and protected species. 

```{r draftmod, echo = F, eval = T}
image.dir <- './images'
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'GBGOMconceptual1.png'))
```

After the initial draft model was developed, working groups were formed to develop three submodels following the CCE example: ecological, environmental, and human dimensions. The general approach was to specify what was being included in each group, what relationship was represented by a link between groups, what threshold of the relationship was used to determine whether a relationship was significant enough to be included (we did not want to model everything), the direction and uncertainty of the link, and documentation of the link between groups. This information was recorded in a spreadsheet. Submodels were then merged together by common components. The process was applied to Georges Bank (GB), the Gulf of Maine (GOM), and the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) ecosystem production units (see EPU section).

#Use this to output a detailed list of the package information
current.session <- sessionInfo(package = NULL)
current.session$otherPkgs
```

<!--List references here.-->
<!--the following line allows reference placement somewhere other than the default end of the doc, if we move the ref section to the end we won't need this-->

### ERDDAP data set
<!--If data are available, adjust code to pull those data and set "eval = T" in chunk header options.-->
Put documentation spreadsheet on ERDDAP as a table?

```{r erddap pull, echo = T, eval = F}
library(rerddap)

comet <- 'http://comet.nefsc.noaa.gov/erddap/'

tab_list <- ed_datasets(url = comet)
tab_list <- data.frame(Title = tab_list$Title,
                        Identifier = tab_list$Dataset.ID,
                        Index = 1:nrow(tab_list))

#Get data set ID (will need to change)
#id <- as.character(tab_list$Identifier[9]) 

#Pull data
data <- tabledap(id,url = comet)

#Print metadata
metadata <- info(id, url = "http://comet.nefsc.noaa.gov/erddap/")$alldata$NC_GLOBAL
cat(metadata[metadata$attribute_name == "lineage processing steps",]$value)

```
