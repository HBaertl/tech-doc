<!--The purpose of this form is to provide the methods used to collect, process, and analyze derived data prior to data submission for all EDAB reports. This information will be compiled into the State of the Ecosystem Tech Memo, AND be used to meet metadata requirements put forth by the Public Access to Research Results (PARR) directive. 

For the tech memo, we will be documenting the methods behind each indicator to the level of a peer-reviewed document.-->

## Methods
Conceptual models were constructed to facilitate multidisciplinary analysis and discussion of the linked social-ecological system for integrated ecosystem assessment. The overall process was to first identify the components of the model (focal groups, human activities, environmental drivers, and objectives), and then to document criteria for including groups and linkages and what the specific links were between the components.

The prototype conceptual model used to design Northeast US conceptual models for each ecosystem production unit (EPU) was designed by the California Current IEA program. The California Current IEA developed an overview conceptual model for the Northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (NCC)  (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/Assets/iea/california/conceptual-models/Integrated-SocioEcological-System-Overview6.png), with models for each focal ecosystem component that detailed the ecological, environmental, and human system linkages (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-overview.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-environmental.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-ecological.html#, https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/focal-components/coastal-pelagic-human.html#). Another set of conceptual models outlined habitat linkages (https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current-region/components/mediating-components/habitat.html). 

An inital conceptual model for Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine was outlined at the 2015 ICES WGNARS meeting. It specified four categories: Large scale drivers, focal ecosystem components, human activities, and human well being. Strategic management objectives were included in the conceptual model, which had not been done in the NCC. Focal ecosystem components were defined as aggregate species groups that had associated US management objectives (outlined within WGNARS for IEAs, see @depiper_operationalizing_2017): groundfish, forage fish, fished invertebrates, living habitat, and protected species.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'GBGOMconceptual1.png'))
```

After the initial draft model was outlined, working groups were formed to develop three submodels following the CCE example: ecological, environmental, and human dimensions. The general approach was to specify what was being included in each group, what relationship was represented by a link between groups, what threshold of the relationship was used to determine whether a relationship was significant enough to be included (we did not want to model everything), the direction and uncertainty of the link, and documentation supporting the link between groups. This information was recorded in a spreadsheet (*make available on ERDDAP*). Submodels were then merged together by common components using the "merge" function in the (currently unavailable) desktop version of Mental Modeler (http://www.mentalmodeler.org/#home; @gray_mental_2013). The process was applied to Georges Bank (GB), the Gulf of Maine (GOM), and the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) ecosystem production units (see EPU section). 

### Data source(s) (All types)
<!--Please provide a text description of data sources.-->
####Ecological submodels
Published food web models for each subregion [@link_documentation_2006; @link_northeast_2008], food habits data collected by NEFSC trawl surveys [@smith_trophic_2010], and other literature sources [@smith_consumption_2015] were consulted. Expert judgement was also used to update from historical information to current conditions. 

####Environmental submodels


####Human dimensions submodels

Identify 
focal groups or species 
human activities and objectives
environmental drivers
Document 
criteria and linkages



### Data extraction 
<!--Text overview description of extraction methods. What information was extracted and how was it aggregated? Can point to other indicator extraction methods if the same.-->
####Ecological submodels
"Data" included model estimated quantities to determine whether inclusion thresholds were met for each potential link in the conceptual model. A matrix with diet composition for each modeled group is an input to the food web model. A matrix of mortalities caused by each predator and fishery on each modeled group is a direct ouput of a food web model (e.g. Ecopath). Food web model biomasss flows between species, fisheries, and detritus were summarized using algorithms implemented in visual basic by Kerim Aydin, NOAA NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Because EMAX model groups were aggregated across species, selected diet compositions for individual species were taken from the NEFSC food habits database using the FEAST program for selected species (example query below). These diet queries were supplemental information. 

Example FEAST sql script for Cod weighted diet on Georges Bank. Queries for different species are standardized by the FEAST application and would differ only in the svspp code.

####Ecological submodels
Aggregated information was examine to determine which links between which groups should be inclded in the conceptual models.The intent was to include only the most important linkages supporting or causing mortality on focal species groups. Therefore,
